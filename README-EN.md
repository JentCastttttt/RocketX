This plugin automatically recognizes the unchanged module and replaces it with aar in the compilation process to speed up the full compilation speed of Android projects.The speed that you can experience is to build all modules like aar, while keeping all modules for easy modification, perfect!

## Gradle Build Speed
![build-speed.png](https://github.com/trycatchx/RocketXPlugin/blob/master/IMG/build-speed.png)

## AGP Version Compatible
Plugin version | Gradle version
---|---
4.0.0+ | 6.1.1+
4.1.0+ | 6.5+
4.2.0+ |6.7.1+
7.0    |7.0+

## How to use

#### Way 1：Network dependence

* add rocketx plugin 

```
// app module build.gradle add code:
apply plugin: 'com.rocketx'
// root Project build.gradle add code:
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.github.trycatchx:rocketx:1.0.17'
    }
}
```

* add android studio plugin by enter android studio setting->plugins-> marketplace,search "RocketX" and install it .

#### Way 2：Local dependence

Download two jars in the lib folder of the project：

* install “rocketX-studio-plugin.jar” by android studio setting->plugins->install plugin from disk 
* Create a new folder Plugin in the root directory of the project, and put rocketx.jar into it，add the following code to build.gradle in the root directory : `classpath fileTree(dir: './Plugin', include: ['*.jar'])`

######  Use to tap the little rocket to the Spitfire icon，, Click the original run button of the compiler to compile :
![assembleDebug](https://github.com/trycatchx/RocketXPlugin/blob/master/IMG/assembleDebug.jpeg)

###### If you have multiple app modules, you can also choose Assemble${flavor}${buildType} task to run


## Problem:
* The first acceleration is the slowest because it needs to be fully compiled, packaged out aar and uploaded to LocalMaven
* At present, if there is a compilation error, please run it again. Any problems are welcome to raise issues.
* set org.gradle.configureondemand = false
